Walmart Dataset

This project done is to gain insights into the performance of the store and identify opportunities for improvement. We need to identify patterns in the data regarding customer segments, product categories, sales, etc. We will do some basic Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore the data and will take the help of Excel functions and features to draw meaningful conclusions. Through this project, we hope to provide valuable insights that can help the store optimize its operations and drive growth.
